# Seattle  
  
## Monthly/Weekly  
### Fremont Sunday Market  
Sundays  
Free  
Small flea/craft market in downtown Fremont  
  
### Ballard Farmers Market  
Sundays  
Free  
Probably my favorite farmers market in Seattle. Produce, fish, eggs, breakfast, cider, and more. Afterwards, check out Twice Sold Tales or the Ballard Locks.  
  
### Fremont Solstice Parade  
Summer  
Free  
The parade is fine but the reason to go is to watch the naked bike riders.  
  
### Dance Church  
Sundays and some other days  
Like a more fun Zumba class. Nonstop dancing for ~80 minutes  
  
### Silent Reading Party  
First Wednesdays  
Free  
A bunch of people getting together to read in silence in a classy setting. No talking, but there is usually someone playing the piano. *Get there at least 20 minutes early*  
  
### 321 Battle  
Every other Friday  
~$20  
Amateur WWE style wrestling.  
  
## Restaurants  
### Joule  
Korean small plates. Great cocktails and good beer selection too.  
### Ba Bar  
Really excellent asian food. I especially like the soups.  
### Xian Noodles  
Cheap eats in U District.  
### Tacos Chukis  
Best tacos in Seattle hands down. Go to the original one in Capital Hill if you can. Finding it can be tricky: it's on the second floor of a shady indoor area. The house taco is what I usually get, though the baby burritos and mulitas are also really good.  
### ~~Il Corvo~~  
~~If you go to one restaurant in Seattle, go here. Delicious handmade pasta. Only open for lunch, menu changes daily. I recommend getting one of each of the three pastas so you can try them all. *Opens at 11am, must get there early (10:40am recommended) since the line gets ridiculous*~~  
### Frelard Pizza
Nice neighborhood pizza place with upscale slices.
### Kamonegi
Soba noodle cafe, high quality japanese food. Great atmosphere as well.
### Schmaltzy's
Deli with an amazing sandwich that uses latkes in place of bread.
  
## Drinks  
### Belmont  
Feels like a high class cocktail lounge.  
### Fremont Brewing  
Nice outdoor beer garden and low key vibes. A neighborhood institution. Can get crowded during peak times.  
### Joule  
Korean fusion small plates  
### Espresso Vivace  
I don't really drink coffee but I make an exception for Espresso Vivace. Their coffee is amazing. Credited with popularizing latte art.  
### Rachel's Ginger Beer  
For some reason Ari and I love this place. Multiple locations.  
### Add A Ball  
Barcade in Fremont  
### Petite Soif  
Natural wine bar in Beacon Hill.  
  
  
## Cafes  
### Sea Wolf  
Amazing bread bakery with good baguettes and savory pastries  
### Milstead and Co  
Nice place to get some work done on a lazy Sunday. Fills up but can usually find a seat.  
### Miir
Airy cafe with great coffee. Similar to Milstead.
  
## Live Music  
### Conor Byrne  
Excellent live music venue in Ballard. Cheap, good beer, friendly atmosphere. Open mic every Sunday night is a treat.  
  
## Beer  
### Stoup German Pilsner  
I really like pilsners, except when they remind me of what Budweiser tastes like. That's to say, I like ___ pilsners. This one fits the bill and is probably my favorite light beer in Seattle.  
  
### Elysian Dragonstooth Stout  
Creamy and flavorful. Good fro dark, cold Seattle nights.  
  
### Populuxe Robust Porter  
Excellent porter with a smooth mouthfeel. Not watery like a lot of porters.  
  
### Fremont Brexit  
A really good British pub ale. Hard to find these in the states. Limited release.  

### Cloudburst Totally Oatally Oatmeal Stout
Smooth and good
  
## Hikes  
### Lake 22  
The inauspiciously named Lake 22 is a relatively short and close hike that ends at a really beautiful lake.  
### Hoh Rainforest to Blue Glacier
Jimmy and I did this as a 3 night hike in summer 2019 and had a blast. You go through old growth rainforest along a beautiful stream, then climb a few thousand feet up to Blue Glacier and back.
### Rachel Lake Trail
Did this one right after a snowstorm and was treated to a true winter wonderland at the top. Some nice waterfalls on the way up too.
### Hidden Lake Lookout
Amazing views across the valley on the way up, and more amazing views from the old fire lookout at the top. Note that the last ~1 mile up to the trailhead is pretty rugged and one part is steep enough to be tough in a sedan.
  
  
## Bookstores  
Seattle is said to have the highest bookstores per capita in the US. I believe it.  
  
### Elliott Bay Books  
Excellent atmosphere, good staff picks, nice place to hang out for an hour, especially on a rainy day.  
  
### Twice Sold Tales (Capital Hill)  
Great fiction and sci-fi offerings. Watch out for the many cats that roam the store.  
  
### Bookstores under Pike Place Market  
The lower levels of Pike Place are host to several used bookstores that are fun to browse.  
  
## Other  
### Pike Place Lower Levels  
Escape the crush of the market and check out the bookstores, knickknack shops, and galleries of the lower level.  
  
### Ballard Locks  
One of my favorite spots in Seattle I could (and have) watched the goings on at the locks for hours, even in the rain.  
  
### Golden Gardens Bonfires  
The city allows bonfires on the beach at Golden Gardens as long as they are contained in a fire pit. On warm weekend nights the beach fills up with people hanging, roasting smores, etc. Beware the roaming police officers: 80% are super nice and just trying to keep people safe, 20% will try to bust you for public drinking. 

### Green Lake Pitch and Putt  
Very fun pitch and putt (short golf) course. Cheap and only 9 holes so you're not committing to a whole day. Open March thru October.
